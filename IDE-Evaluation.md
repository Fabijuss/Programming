## Introduction
This short report will evaluate the use of an IDE for Application Development as opposed to not using one. The project which has been created with an IDE is the Higher or Lower game, while the project which did not use an IDE is the Trace Ball game. The report will cover the benefits and drawbacks of both.

## IDE
The project which was created using an IDE is the Higher or Lower game. This project was completed using the repl.it online IDE, which has been covered in a previous report. The main IDE features which were used for the development of this project include:
+ Version Control – The IDE was used to manage different versions of the project created, the project had been created in four major versions, each one expanding on the next. 
+ Cloud-based – The IDE was used on multiple different systems, allowing for the development to be carried out regardless of location.
+ Debugger – The debugger was used to double-check the values in the application, to ensure that they are working as intended.

## No IDE
The project which was developed using no IDE is the Trace ball game. This was instead created using the general text editor named ‘Notepad’. Due to the lack of features of this method of coding, various features had to be improvised. One such example of this was version control, as notepad has no development features, the version control had to be done manually – by saving files separately and making back-ups. This was not much of an inconvenience, but it is an extra step that has to be taken.

Another feature which had to be improvised is project portability. As notepad cannot save files to the cloud, or anywhere online. The project files had to be saved and uploaded to a file hosting service (google drive) in order for the project files to be accessed and worked on in a different location.  

One of the harder parts of developing using no IDE was the debugging. Notepad has no syntax highlighting, or any form of debugging which most IDEs have. This resulted in a lot of confusion when trying to test and debug the application, as the source of the bug had to be located manually or by trial and error. Furthermore, detecting what type of error had occurred was even more difficult, as there is no indication of whether the error is a logic problem, or an issue with the code itself.  

## Comparison
Version control for the IDE and non IDE projects was quite similar, this is because it was more of a convenience than a required tool during the development of these two applications. However, if the applications were being developed on a larger scale or longer time period, then the IDE version control would be much more useful in the development process.

The project accessibility was more of a difference between the two projects. The IDE project was easy to pick up and continue on the development, between different devices and locations. Meanwhile the non-IDE variant required files to be saved, downloaded, and backed-up during the process of development. This had caused several issues, as it was easy to confuse the different versions of the files on different systems, especially when uploading them back to the file hosting service where they can easily be mixed up with the wrong version. 

The debugging aspect of development was the largest difference between the two methods of development. This is where the IDE could be considered a necessity, as otherwise the process of debugging is too time-consuming and difficult. During the development of the Higher or Lower game, there were few times where the application development had to be halted in order to solve bugs, as they were solved almost instantaneously. Meanwhile, the development of Trace ball had multiple stops which digging in the application in order to find the bug, and then figure out the best solution to the problem. 

## Conclusion
To conclude, while it is entirely possible to develop applications using just a text editor and no IDE or external tools. It is clear that using the IDE is the more advantageous option, especially for serious development. The advantages of using an IDE greatly outweigh the benefits of not using one. Several processes such as debugging, management and coding in general are greatly increased in terms of efficiency when using an IDE, as it skips several steps out of the normal processes and sometimes automates the process entirely.
