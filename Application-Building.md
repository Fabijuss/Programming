## Introduction
This short report will cover the processes which are used in the building of an application, this includes the different models and phases of development. In addition, algorithms and their uses within programming will be explored.

The development process of an application will be split up and looked at in their individual parts. The following parts will be looked at and covered in particular:
+ Requirements   
+ Design   
+ Implementation   
+ Testing   
+ Maintenance
