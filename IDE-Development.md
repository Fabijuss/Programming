## Introduction
This report will cover the use of an IDE in the development process of a program. The program in question is the Higher or Lower game. This program was developed using the ![repl.it](https://repl.it/) online IDE. The different aspects of the IDE and their uses in the development will be outlined.  

## Integrated Development Environment
The IDE used was an online IDE named ![repl.it](https://repl.it/). This is a light IDE used for quick development and deployment of programs, and includes some of the main features of a full-sized IDE.

The above screenshot is the home page of the online IDE. It highlights how quick the process is, only requiring to sign up with an account, allowing access to the IDE on any internet-enabled device. It is possible to use a GitHub account to sign up with, which skips the usual sign-up steps.

## Features
This IDE has a number of features suitable for the development of a program. Some of the features included are the following:

### Programming Languages
This IDE is compatible with almost every programming available, it loads the syntax and libraries for every different language automatically. Files that are created in the specified language use the correct extensions, allowing the files to be exported and used directly from the IDE to a computer.  Some of the main and most popular languages include: Python, Ruby, Nodejs, HTML, CSS, JS, C# and Java. 

### Cloud-based
The IDE is cloud-based, this means that projects and their files are not stored locally. This gives the advantage of allowing the project to be accessed and modified on any internet-enabled compatible device. Furthermore, this means that files cannot be lost or corrupted, meaning that there is no need for back-ups of project files, unless they are being modified. 

### Sharing
It is possible to share projects and their files easily online. Since it is an online IDE, anyone can access the project files unless they are made private. This can help in the development of projects that may require files to be viewed or edited by people across the world. Furthermore, it means that projects created by other people can be viewed and analysed in order to learn techniques or gain knowledge on certain topics. 

### Embedding
This IDE allows for the actual IDE itself to be embedded into websites, this makes it easy to showcase certain parts of code, as their functionality can be viewed without having to save and run the code on the computer itself.

### Debugging 
The IDE has a debugger which allows the call stack to be viewed, and the code to be run in steps so the values of variables and functions can be viewed to ensure that they are working intentionally.

### Live Updates
The IDE updates files live, adding files as they are created, removing files, or modifying existing files. This allows testing of the application without having to save and execute the full application.  

### Version Control
The IDE saves any revisions to the project files in a ‘history’ tab. This allows the project to be reverted to an older version if needed, as well as being able to view all of the changes that occurred in that version.

The above screenshot shows an example of the version control that the IDE features, it shows every change done to the program, sorted according to the time it was committed. The changes are sorted in days, and any version of the code can be restored using the ‘restore’ button.
 
## Uses
A number of the features available in the IDE were utilised in the development of the project, not all features were used as they were not required. The following are the features that were used:

+ Version Control – The IDE was used to manage different versions of the project created, the project had been created in four major versions, each one expanding on the next.
+ Cloud-based – The IDE was used on multiple different systems, allowing for the development to be carried out regardless of location.
+ Debugger – The debugger was used to double-check the values in the application, to ensure that they are working as intended.

## Development Process
The development process for this project relied heavily on the version control and cloud-based nature of the IDE.

The project started with a simple prototype application, which was used to test some concepts that were in the requirements, i.e. random number generation. Throughout the entire project, the cloud-based nature allowed the project to be worked on at different locations and systems.

Moving onwards, version control was used to develop the initial prototype into the first version of the program. This process was repeated multiple times, adding more features with each revision, until the final version was complete.

Throughout the development process, mostly at the end of each version, the debugger was used to double-check that the values are correct in the application, to ensure that it works as intended.

## Conclusion
To conclude, the use of an IDE to develop an application allowed for the project to be managed much easier than if it would have been done independently. Some of the features such as the IDE being cloud-based allowed the project to be worked on in different environments and without the need to transfer any files across systems. Furthermore, the other tools such as syntax highlighting or debugger allowed the code to be written with confidence, knowing that the are no simple mistakes. Additionally, the version control available, allowed the project to be developed in steps, building on each version with additional features until the program was complete, streamlining the overall process.
