# Introduction
This report will cover three programming paradigms; procedural, event-driven and object-orientated. Along with this, the relationship between them will be explored and compared.

## Paradigms
A paradigm in programming is a particular methodology used in the creation of software. The programming paradigm that will be used in software creation will be determined by the types of issues that may be faced during the development. There are a number of different paradigms commonly used in programming, and new paradigms may be created in order to solve future problems. Each paradigm aims to solve a specific issue. Some paradigms are better suited for specific tasks, though most paradigms are capable of solving every issue if a different approach is used. For example, event-driven programming is best suited if the software requires a lot of response from the user.

### Procedural Programming
The procedural programming paradigm is a methodology which is quite simple, it is commonly the first type of programming a beginner programmer will learn. This is because the procedural paradigm offers a few core features that make it simple to learn and use. One such feature is the ability to reuse procedures, in most programming languages that comes in the form of functions. This gives the code a degree of modularity, allowing functions to be called when needed to perform the same action in multiple places in the code. Another feature of this paradigm is that it has simple data types, this makes it simple for a programmer to choose the data types they require in specific parts of the code. Another core feature of procedural programming is that it allows for control flow, most languages using this paradigm allow for while/for loops and if statements. Paired with the top-to-bottom execution style some languages have, this gives a lot of flexibility to the flow of the program.

### Event Driven Programming
This paradigm is a methodology which utilises inputs from the user in order to trigger events. This can range from inputs such as clicks, scrolls, mouse movement, keyboard, etc. in return the program is capable of responding by changing the state of the program, or activating a process. Using this paradigm means that a user is required to use the application and give inputs, otherwise, nothing will happen on its own. This paradigm is often used for the creation of interactive applications such as websites.

### Object-Orientated Programming
This is a paradigm which uses objects with data and methods, these come in the form of classes that interact with each other to carry out the tasks of the application. This paradigm allows for a lot of modularity and reusability; this is one of the main advantages of object-orientated programming(OOP). There are many uses for this type of paradigm, one of which is that it can be used for long-term applications. Due to the nature of OOP, it can be easily changed and adapted, even over a long period of time â€“ ideal for applications that evolve over time. This paradigm is commonly the first that programmers learn, though it can be initially hard to grasp all the concepts. 

## Relationship
Most paradigms have similarities and differences which can be linked to one another; this is in their nature as each paradigm has been created after another, in order to solve different problems.

Event-driven programming is different from Procedural programming in a fundamental way; in Procedural programming, you write exactly what will happen in order, and decide what values variables will have. Meanwhile, in Event-driven you write functions and wait for them to be triggered, arguments are decided when the function is triggered. However, they do share a similarity, while the events themselves are event-driven, the actual code in the event listeners is procedural as they contain functions calls and logic which must be carried out in the order they are written in. 

Object-orientated programming is different to both Event-driven and Procedural programming, this is because it takes a different approach to the implementation of the code, instead of writing the code in a logical order, or based on inputs. While OOP does have a similarity in that the classes are similar to functions found in both other paradigms, they are fundamentally different. Instead, classes and objects are used, a class acts as a blueprint while the object is the actual instance of a class which has real variables. For example, the class is a car, while an object would be a red, blue or green car. 

## Conclusion
To conclude, it is clear that paradigms are important in programming and are the defining feature of what programming is today. Each paradigm has its own use specific use, but they are capable of being used interchangeably with a different approach to the problem in most cases. Event-driven is most useful for interactive web applications; Procedural is most useful for straightforward applications with a specific logic in mind, and Object-orientated is best suited for applications which require a lot of modularity and reusability, or with long-term projects.
