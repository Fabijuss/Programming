## Introduction
This report will evaluate the use of coding standards for the individual and for team environments. There will be two main sections, covering the reasons behind using coding standards, one for the individual and one for team environments. 

## Coding Standards
A coding standard for a project or programming language can be considered as the ‘ruleset’ for the development of the program. It defines how the structure of the code should be laid out, and is always kept the same throughout the entire code. There a number of aspects that coding standards cover. Some of them are the following:

+ Naming conventions – This decides how variables and function are named. An example is camelCase, e.g. variableName. 
+ Spacing – This decides how spacing is used between separate entities in the code. 
+ Comments – This decides how comments are used throughout the code, the type of comments used and how they are structured.
+ Functions – This decides how functions are presented. For example:

      Int main()
      {
      Code
      }
+ Indentation – This decides how many tabs or spaces are used for indenting code.

## Individual Use
There are a number of reasons that coding standards should be employed when developing individually. One of the main reasons is to keep the programs that are written consistent, changing the coding standards in every program would cause a lot of confusion and result in it being hard to understand more than one program if looking at multiple projects.

Another reason for using coding standards individually would be to ensure that projects can still be worked on even if they have not been developed or used in a long period of time. It is likely that the function of the code could be forgotten after a period of time. However, if the coding standard is known, then the application could be figured out quickly by seeing the layout of the code. 

Additionally, an application may not be developed for a long period of time, if the application is written without any standards, it may be incomprehensible and would either be useless, or would have to be written from scratch in order to use once again. Meanwhile, with the use of coding standards, the application could be reused without having to be rewritten again.

## Team Environment
Coding standards are especially important in the context of a team environment. This is because projects require large amounts of coordination and organisation in order to be completed successfully, and having no standards for the writing of code will be severely detrimental to the development. With the use of a coding standard, multiple people are able to work on different parts of code, which can then be pieced together without compatibility issues. 

Large projects often have employees join and leave unexpectedly during the middle of development. This can result in code having to be developed by another person, a coding standard ensures that the new programmer is able to continue the development without having to start from scratch. Thus reducing any waste in time which may otherwise be caused by someone leaving.

## Conclusion
To conclude, it is evident that coding standards should be used if the programming is being taken seriously. For the individual, having coding standards allows for code to be developed and reused even after a large period of time, which would otherwise cause the code to be obsolete. Meanwhile, for a team environment the coding standards are even more crucial. This is because team environments rely heavily on coordination and teamwork, which would otherwise not be possible if not everyone follows the same standards in the team.
