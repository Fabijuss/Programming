## Introduction
This short report will cover the features available in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The different features and uses of IDEs will be explored in this report. Along with this, the debugging facilities in certain IDEs will be outlined. Some examples of IDEs will be also be covered in regard to these facilities. 

## Integrated Development Environment
An IDE is an application used to aid the process of application development, they come with a number of features which increase the ease of development as well as the speed of the process exponentially. Most programmers use IDEs as they aid them in various ways, reducing the amount of time spent debugging and reducing any simple human errors in the code.
 
### Features
IDEs often come with many features which aid the process of application development. Some of these features can be considered essential, while others are "quality of life" improvements. The following are some examples of such features:

#### Source Code Editor
This is a common tool in every IDE, it allows the source code of the application to be edited directly from the IDE. Most IDEs allow multiple files to be open and edited at once, which can be useful when having to make changes across multiple different files. The source code editor in IDEs usually includes a few utilities such as auto-complete common words or existing keywords in the code, as well as spell check and syntax highlighting.

#### Debugger
This feature comes in many forms in IDEs, usually in the form of multiple tools which exponentially speed up the process of application debugging. These tools are capable of finding the location of the bug, identifying what kind of bug it is, and even giving suggestions which can solve the bug. These tools allow for easier development of an application, as well as easier testing once the application is deemed complete.

#### Compiler
This feature allows the source code to be compiled into an executable. Certain applications can be executed in the IDE itself, allowing for testing and debugging without having to exit the IDE. As well as allowing changes to be quickly added. Most IDEs allow the compiler to compile the project based on the user defined settings, such as the programming language and any libraries used for the project. This method skips a number of steps which would otherwise have to be done outside of the IDE.

#### Syntax Highlighting
This is a feature most IDEs have, it changes the colours and fonts of certain words based on the keywords in different programming languages. Its main purpose is to improve readability of the code, as large quantities of code can appear to be the same when skimmed over, thus having different fonts and colours gives the code a lot more distinction. Some IDEs also come with spell check, this acts as a pre-emptive debugger, solving potential bugs before they can even appear. 

#### Customisation
One of the main features of an IDE comes in the form of customisation. This feature allows the user to personalise the IDE to what works best for them. Many IDEs have a lot of freedom in terms of what can be changed, ranging from basic changes such as themes, fonts and colours, to more complex changes such as custom commands and shortcuts or plugins. This can help programmers work at their most efficiency by giving them the tools they require which may not come by default.

#### Management Tools
This is a feature of the IDE that allows management of the application, this can involve multiple different tools ranging from file management to project management. Most IDEs allow for files to be created, imported, edited or removed from within the IDE. This helps save time, as well as allowing the files to be created using the project settings automatically. Project management tools in IDEs include global project settings, which keeps the files in the project compatible with each other, or allows for the project to be compiled and built using a certain language or library. 

### Debugging Facilities
Debugging is a major phase of the development process, it is vital that bugs are located and fixed to ensure that the application works as intended before being released. IDEs often come with a number of debugging features, which make the process much easier, and allow for overall better debugging. The following are some examples of debugging facilities available in IDEs:

#### Breakpoints

This debugging tool allows the code to have set points in which the application stops. The main usage of this tool is to allow the programmer to inspect the values that certain variables have at certain points in the application, to ensure that they are as intended. This is important to ensure that issues do not arise in the future, as the application may work with incorrect values but the outcome could produce errors or unexpected results.

#### Output Console

This tool is used to output certain information into a console. The console usually reports any errors which are picked up while the application is running. It is possible to attach the console to certain parts of the code, allowing for uses such as outputting the variables into the console so that they can be inspected. The console can also be a useful tool when checking if everything works as intended. For example, it can be used to check if a script file has been loaded correctly, by seeing if any errors occurred in the console while loading the script.

#### Diagnostics

This is a tool used to assist in troubleshooting issues such as memory leaks, memory fragmentation, crashes, slow performance and hangs. This tool analyses the code of the application by using built-in rules from various applications and Microsoft technologies. Once it analyses, any detected problems are outlined so that they may be fixed. The diagnostics tool can be useful when there are various performance issues with the application, but the source of the problem is not clear. It can also be useful when there is a lot of code or when the code is complex, which may cause the problem to not be apparent.

#### Variable changing

This tool is used to change variable in the code during runtime. This can be done by using the aforementioned breakpoints in order to stop code in certain parts, and then changing the variables in order to test different outcomes. This can be useful to test what kind of values can cause errors in the application, so that the code does not accept them. It can also be used to test input variables quickly, without having to run the code every time to see each input’s outcome.

#### Call stack viewing

This tool is used to see what functions are called at certain points in the program. As with variable changing, this tool utilises breakpoints in order to see what functions have been called at certain points in the program. This tool can be useful when checking if functions have been called correctly and in the right order. Furthermore, it can be used to check the values which are currently being used in the functions. This can be very important as a function relying on certain values may break the entire code if the values are incorrect.

## Conclusion
To conclude, it is evident that Integrated Development Environments are very useful in the process of application development. They are able to automate and simplify many areas of the programming process, such as debugging and compiling. Furthermore, it can help programmers work at maximum efficiency by customising their IDE to suit their personal preferences. Additionally, the management tools available aid in the management and organisation of the project, allowing the files to be sorted, or modified accordingly.

Overall, the use of an IDE is personal preference as it is entirely possible to program without an IDE. However, the added benefits of an IDE make it much easier for any programmer who is not completely confident in their ability to program independently. The tools available in an IDE can be helpful even to a programmer that prefers to work in a non-IDE environment, as they save a large amount of time and skip many steps that would normally have to be done manually.
