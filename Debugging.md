## Introduction
This short-form report will cover the process of debugging an application, and the debugging facilities available in Integrated Development Environments. Debugging will be defined and the process of debugging will be explored in this report.

The debugging facilities found in Integrated Development Environments which will be covered in this report are the following:
+ Breakpoints
+ Output Console
+ Diagnostics
+ Variable changing
+ Call stack viewing

## Debugging

### What is debugging?
